### Instruction

In `prime.c`, fill out `is_prime` function. The function returns 1 when the input is is prime number, and returns 0 when input is not a prime number. 

To run this, go to the HW1 folder and type the following:
```shell
g++ prime.c -o ./prime
```
For Mac user, open the Mac Terminal and execute:

```shell
./prime
```

For Windows users, open Windows Powershell and run:
```shell
./prime.exe
```
The program should be able to print out all the prime numbers within 100.

Try to figure out how to compile and run `sort.c` using the same way. Please try to Baidu or Google sorting algorithm and implement `bubble_sort` and `select_sort`.
